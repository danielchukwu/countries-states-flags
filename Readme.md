# Countries States and Country Flags

The names of the flags are the same as the names of the countries

e.g
`united-states.svg` in the 📁 flags2 folder maps to `"United States"` or `"united states"` in countries_data.js

so if you want to get each countries flag svg icon you would need to convert `<Country Name>` to lower case to get `<country name>` and then replace the `space` with `-` to get `<country-name>` then append .svg to get `<country-name>.svg` smile
